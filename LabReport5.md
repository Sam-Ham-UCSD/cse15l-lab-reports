# Lab Report 5

By Sammy Hamouda

## Part 1




## Part 2

A cool thing I learned in lab, and from the class overall, in the latter half of this quarter is simply the fact that vim exists. Learning that you can edit files directly from the command line was an amazing thing. Along those lines, learning of jdb was also cool. Albiet, I would prefer not to use it unless I am forced to by circumstances.
