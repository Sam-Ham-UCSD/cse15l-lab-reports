# Lab Report 5

By Sammy Hamouda

## Part 1




## Part 2

A cool thing I learned in lab, and from the class overall, in the latter half of this quarter is simply the fact that vim exists. Learning that you can edit files directly from the command line was an amazing thing. The controls for it also are pretty decent, although I will say that the nano that the professor uses looks easier to use as it gives instructions in the editing of a file. Along those lines, learning about jdb was also cool. Albiet, I would prefer not to use it unless I am forced to by circumstances such as not being able to use VScode.
